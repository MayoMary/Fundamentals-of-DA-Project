# Fundamentals-of-DA-Project

## Project Title : Fundamentals-of-DA-Project to create a box plot using Iris dataset.
### The project is based on using the boxplot function from the Python package matplotlib.pyplot

## Background : 
### Iris dataset was initroduced by Ronald Fischer, a british statistician and biologist in 1936. 
### Fischer developed a linear model to distingush the species from each other. 
### The dataset contains sets of data for 3 varieties of the Iris flower - Sentosa, Versicolor and Virginica.
### 50 data readings were collected for these 3 varieties under the following 4 attributes - sepal width and length and petal width and length. 
### Need to import the data, create a box plot to see the data visually.

## The importance of box plot
### Its ability to show multiple sets of data visually in a small space for easy comparison. 

## Code language
### Jupyter Notebooks using Python3

## DataSource
### Need to import a file with the IRIS dataset. Link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
